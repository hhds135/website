# Engineering Design Review - Q&A

## Is there a sample EDR?

Yes, you can find a [sample EDR on Canvas](https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/77855/files/17771585?wrap=1).

## Can I choose my own project?

Yes. After choosing which of the two organisations you want to work for (Student Smart Homes or Higher Education Software Solutions), you can then have the following two options:

1. Choose 1 of the 3 suggested projects for that organisation
2. Or choose your own project related to the existing products of that organisation

If you choose Option 2, make sure that your project is similar in scope to the suggested projects. If in doubt whether your own project idea is suitable, ask.

## Is there an expected word count or limit?

No. The only constraint is that your EDR should be around 5 pages long. Word counts are a distraction. Focus on the quality of what you are writing.

## Section X of the sample EDR has Y-many words, does that mean my EDR should have Y-many words for Section X?

No. Word counts are a distraction. Focus on the quality of what you are writing. Depending on your project and design, Section X may have Y-many words or Z-many words. What matters is that you write about what you have to convey to your readers and do so well.

## The sample EDR has X and does not have Y, does that mean my EDR needs to contain X and not Y?

No. The sample EDR is an EDR document for a particular project with a particular design. Depending on your project and design, the contents of the sections may vary. Some EDRs may only contain text. Others may contain tables. Others may contain diagrams. Others may contain code. Others may contain a mix of all these things. It depends on what you need to illustrate what you are writing about.

## Can I change the structure of the EDR?

No. You must stick to the structure that is outlined in the coursework specification. However, you can break those sections down further into sub-sections if you find that useful. See the sample EDR for an example.

## Are there any formatting requirements (font family, font size, margins, etc.)?

No. I trust you to make reasonable choices for the format of your document. Anything that is easily readable is fine, such as commonly used fonts in 12pt size. If I can't read your document (because e.g. your font is too small, or you have squeezed too many words onto each page) then you will only gain marks for what I can read.

## How much should I account for The Prototype coursework when writing my EDR?

You should not. Write your EDR as you would write it if the second coursework did not exist.

## Where should I outline my assumptions about how the existing systems in the organisation work?

You can do this either explicitly in any place that makes logical sense or just refer to your assumptions naturally in your writing. See the sample EDR for how assumptions about the existing systems are woven into the narrative there. Only include what’s necessary for your design.

## What are milestones?

Primarily they serve to break the implementation of the design down into phases, but what those phases are can vary. The primary characteristic of a milestone is that there’s some decision point at the end of the milestone that allows you to evaluate whether to proceed to the next milestone or stop the work. See the sample EDR for examples.

## What methodology should I use to plan the work?

An EDR has nothing to do with planning work. The primary goal of an EDR is to capture a design that can then be reviewed by others. The milestones are for managing risk, not deciding how long something will take.

## How much detail should I go into about the testing?

As much as necessary to covey how you expect to be able to assess whether the implementation is working as expected.

## What are "risks"?

Risks generally. Broad examples of categories of risks: the design not working as expected, damaging reputation with customers, costing a lot, breaking something else, etc. See the sample EDR for some examples.
