<p>
  For many of you, a degree in Computer Science will be the stepping stone to a
  career in software engineering. At the same time, most of your experience
  building software has been to write some Java code on your own, compile it
  directly with the Java compiler, and run it on your own machine. Real software
  engineering is very different.
</p>
<p>
  In this module, we will explore the gap between the programming you will have
  done in your first year and the real software engineering you are likely to do
  in your careers. You will be introduced to the different contexts that
  software engineering takes place in and the different processes that
  organisations may employ surrounding it. Furthermore, you will gain
  foundational knowledge of relevant tools and technical skills.
</p>

<h2>Optional Slack team &amp; How to get in touch</h2>

<p>
  There is an <strong>optional</strong> Slack team for this module. Slack is a
  tool for real-time collaboration, similar to Microsoft Teams, that is commonly
  used in industry. Due to its use in industry, I have set up a Slack team for
  this module that we can use to quickly discuss your questions more effectively
  than via email. You can
  <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/uob-sepp/signup"
    >sign up for an account on it</a
  >
  (note that you cannot and should not try to log in with your Birmingham
  password). You can use this to ask questions about lectures, about the
  coursework, or software engineering more generally in one of the channels. You
  can also send me direct messages with your questions. For all this, you can
  choose to remain anonymous as well as you are not required to sign up with
  your real name. Participation is entirely optional and all key information
  related to the module will be communicated via other channels, such as this
  website or email.
</p>

<p>
  If you prefer not to use Slack, you can reach me with questions at any time at
  <a href="mailto:m.gale@bham.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >m.gale@bham.ac.uk</a
  >.
</p>

<h2>Module guide</h2>

<p>
  There is a module guide for this module which aims to contain all key
  information, including the coursework specifications. I will aim to expand
  this guide with more information as the module progresses. You can

</p>

<h2>Lectures</h2>
<p>The module runs in Weeks 1-11 of Term 1.</p>
<p>Lectures take place at 11am-1pm every Wednesday (UNI-Avon Room).</p>
<p>
  I will aim to make lecture slides available in good time before each
  respective lecture, but note that the slides may be subject to changes until
  the lecture takes place.
